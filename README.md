# African Drought Atlas

This repository contains the code and resources for the African Drought Atlas (ADA), a project aimed at developing a comprehensive understanding of hydro-climatic extreme events in the Africa region. The ADA is inspired by the successful Drought Atlas for Latin America and Caribbean released by UNESCO-IHP and CAZALAC.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from researchers, meteorologists, hydrologists, and anyone interested in advancing our understanding of hydro-climatic extreme events in Africa. If you have valuable data, insights, or improvements to the methodology, we encourage you to contribute to this repository.
